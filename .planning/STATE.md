## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Roadmap: Full P1-8 scope from specs/roadmap.md preserved as-is (8 integer phases); granularity=standard compression guidance overridden by explicit user scope choice.
- Roadmap: Per-feature service layer (PLAT-01) and validation layer (PLAT-02) introduced starting Phase 1, not deferred.
- Roadmap: Phase 2 ships a minimal/seeded availability model; Phase 4 makes the same model staff-editable — one system, not two.
- Roadmap: No-show modeled as a first-class terminal status starting Phase 3.
- Roadmap: Guest checkout (Phase 6) is independent of Accounts (Phase 7) — `Order.ClientId` nullable.
- Roadmap: `ZachHairStudio.Admin` MVC scaffold flagged as legacy/retire — noted at Phase 3, retirement criterion in Phase 8.

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- REQUIREMENTS.md header/coverage text said "34 requirements" but the actual v1 list totals 41 — corrected in the Traceability/Coverage section during roadmap creation; worth a quick sanity check with the user.
- Phase 2 (Booking Core), Phase 6 (Cart & Checkout), and Phase 7 (Accounts & Retention) are flagged for a deeper per-phase research pass before planning (see ROADMAP.md Research flag annotations and research/SUMMARY.md Research Flags section).
- Payment provider (Phase 6) and auth provider/session strategy (Phase 7) remain open decisions per PROJECT.md Key Decisions — confirm before planning those phases.
